Recruitment task
================

## Rules:

1. Fork this `gist` and download it locally.
2. The task is to make tests pass and code work.
3. Fell free to add some structure to the code.
4. You are allowed to add extra files if it's needed for better design.
5. The only thing you cannot change are files: `item_test.rb` and `item.rb`, rest is up to you.
6. You have **1 hour** for this.
7. Push your work back to the `gist` in the end.
8. I'm here to help you in case of any questions, concerns, etc. Treat me like your companion in pair programming session. But I shouldn't touch keyboard to change anything you have done. I will also try to help you if anything would look unclear to me.

Good luck!
